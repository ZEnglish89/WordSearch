# WordSearch

A program which uses recursion to solve wordsearch puzzles. This is the midterm project for CSE031, my fourth semester of college.
Completed in slightly under one week with the help of Christian Luchetta.
The program is allowed to "cheat"(change directions) in the solving, specifically because making it play by the rules would have been trivially easy, and this represents a slightly more significant task.
